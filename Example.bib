  abstract = {We developed a broadly applicable method for estimating stock-specific spatial distributions based on patterns in contacts per unit effort determined from data collected in ocean fisheries. The method fully accounts for fishing effort and quantifies uncertainty in total contacts due to sampling error and the effects of annual variability in size-at-age on estimated contacts with sublegal-sized fish. As a case study, we used coded-wire tag recoveries to compare ocean spatial distributions among fish from four return run timings (fall, late-fall, winter, and spring) of Chinook salmon from the Central Valley, California, USA, and explored how distributions varied annually, seasonally, and with fish age in the data-rich fall run. All runs were rarely contacted in ocean fisheries north of Cape Falcon, Oregon (45{$^\circ$}46{$\prime$}N). Late-fall and winter run fish appeared relatively restricted to the south compared with fall run fish, corresponding to life history differences and highlighting the ability of spatial management to control impacts on the endangered winter run. For the fall run, the location of highest relative contacts per unit effort of age-3 fish varied across years. This variation correlated with sea surface temperature the previous summer, suggesting ocean distributions may be more responsive to the environment than previously appreciated.},

  abstract = {This paper summarizes information on recent historical distribution and abundance of chinook salmon in the California Central Valley drainage, focusing on the period from the 1950s to today. Most of the principal Central Valley streams that historically supported salmon runs still do so, but nearly half of them have lost at least one seasonal salmon run and several major streams have had all their salmon runs extirpated. Overall abundance of chinook salmon in the Central Valley system has decreased to less than 75\% of their number in the 1950s. Fall-run chinook salmon in the Sacramento River basin compose by far the most abundant Central Valley stocks, but they substantially declined between 1953--1966 and 1967--1991. Fall-run chinook salmon stocks in the San Joaquin River basin and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta tributaries showed various changes between 1953--1966 and 1967--1991 but altogether constitute only a minor portion (now 4\%) of the total Central Valley spawning escapements. Three other chinook salmon runs (winter, spring, late-fall) have shown much more pronounced reductions in recent decades. Central Valley salmon have been heavily supported by hatchery production, but the effects of hatcheries on natural stocks remain poorly understood. Major efforts are underway to restore regional chinook salmon and steelhead stocks, several of which are listed under both California and U.S. endangered species statutes.}
