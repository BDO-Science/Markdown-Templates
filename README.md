This repository includes template Quarto (.qmd) files for a presentation, report, and manuscript. Additional files are needed to run the templates and should be included in the repository. CSL files for journals can be found here https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=%5C. Rstudio uses Tinytex to convert files. It may be necessary to install additional components of Tinytex. Template word document and pdf (.tex) files can be changed to fit the users needs.
